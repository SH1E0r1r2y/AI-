Am I being unreasonable with for my Chinese girlfriends pension ?
I (53M) have a Chinese girlfriend (55F) who is currently living with me in the UK and we plan to get married early next year. We both have families from previous marriages, difference is her children are grown up and independent while mine are still in school.
I have my kids 50% of the week, and my ex has them the other half. My gf is brilliant with them and they love her to bits.
We have a very ‚Äútraditional‚Äù domestic arrangement where I earn the money and she does the house work. Don‚Äôt get me wrong I don‚Äôt sit back, I do cleaning and cooking too, but she does the majority of the domestic side of things and we‚Äôre both happy with this arrangement.
She has a private pension in China that I agreed I would pay for as she‚Äôs in the uk and cannot easily generate income. This amounts to about ¬£1500 a month which of course I have to pay out of my net pay after tax (so this is more like ¬£2500 a month of earned income).
I have a pretty good job so I can just about afford this ¬£1500/m together with school fees for my two children of ¬£1500/m a small interest only mortgage on my house plus bills and general expenses that adds in another ¬£2500/m, plus the occasional nice holiday for us and my kids.
She has both my Amex and debit card setup on her phone so she uses those when she goes shopping and thankfully she‚Äôs not extravagant, but equally she never has to worry about this expenditure or ask me for approval. I also put ¬£100/m into her current account , which I know isn‚Äôt much but means she builds up a little pocket money to spend privately however she wants. She also does a little part time work helping her friend out and earns a bit more money that way, sometimes a couple of hundred a week.
Now after all these expenses I am able to save a grand total of zero per month. Specifically I am unable to pay off the capital on my mortgage and unable to save any money for a rainy day. However if we tighten our belts a bit (no 10k holiday each year) then I should be able to save a little bit into my pension and pay off the mortgage.
I‚Äôve been completely open book with her about the finances and shown her all the accounts and numbers. But even so she acts like she is hard done by and that the ¬£1500 a month is not much.
I clearly point out that there is a cake of a certain size and I make sure everybody including her gets a slice and it‚Äôs only me left with the crumbs. I point out in the last two years she has had zero cost of living, had her pension paid and that out of the two of us it is only her that has saved anything for their future during this time from my earnings.
I don‚Äôt begrudge the money I pay to her pension every month but I do resent the fact there is zero appreciation and no  acknowledgment that however little she might think this is, it‚Äôs a damn sight more than I‚Äôm getting.
This all came to a head this evening when I told her I‚Äôd sold a guitar of mine that I‚Äôd had for years but never really played. I sold it to try to free up some funds to reduce my debt.  I got 1000 for it. However I lost my temper when she said I can spend that money on holiday in China this year visiting her family.
Now I know there‚Äôs this whole ‚Äúface‚Äù culture in China about having to appear successful and splash your ‚Äúwestern‚Äù money around, but I‚Äôve already budgeted 10k for this trip and the implication that the proceeds of the sale of my personal possession is just more money to be frittered away on holiday really pissed me off.
This then led to her saying that I don‚Äôt give her enough and she doesn‚Äôt feel secure. I then pointed out that she owns a house with no mortgage in China (4 bed modern flat), and a buy to let properly she rents out in Macau, plus she gets 1500 invested to her pension every month, while I have a mortgage I can‚Äôt service the capital on and I save nothing for my future - so imagine how insecure I feel! I‚Äôve said I‚Äôm happy to listen any ideas she has about how we ‚Äúbetter divide the cake‚Äù, but she is not forthcoming with any.
Now we can both save for the future and have a very nice retirement together if we tighten our belts a bit, but we have to work together and be reasonable.
However my attempt to explain this rationally has fallen on deaf ears and she‚Äôs now talking about staying in China after our holiday to ‚Äúthink about our relationship‚Äù.
Any advice would be welcomed
