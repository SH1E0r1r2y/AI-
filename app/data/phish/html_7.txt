Details of the MetaMask Airdrop:
üö® Attention everyone! The popular crypto wallet, Metamask, has announced an exciting new airdrop
                        of its native token called Mask.
üëÄ This is a great opportunity to get your hands on some free tokens and join the Metamask
                        community. The airdrop is expected to be highly popular, so you won't want to miss out!
üéÅ The details of the airdrop are as follows: Metamask will be distributing a total of 5 million
                        Mask tokens to eligible wallet holders. To qualify, you must have used Metamask to make at least
                        one transaction since June 2023.
üëâ The airdrop will take place in three stages, starting on June 22 and ending on July 10. The
                        distribution will be based on a snapshot of eligible wallets taken at the beginning of each
                        stage.
üí∞ The amount of tokens you receive will depend on the number of eligible wallets and the phase
                        you participate in. The earlier you participate, the more tokens you are likely to receive.
üîí So, what are you waiting for? Make sure you have used Metamask for at least one transaction
                        since June 2023, and get ready to claim your free Mask tokens during the airdrop!
Don't miss out on this exciting opportunity to join the Metamask community and get some free
                        tokens!
